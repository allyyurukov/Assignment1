This is a python sript that is created to be a user-friendrly file management tool which lists files in a specific way. The script prompts you to enter a command. If you type 'L' followed by a directory path, you'll see the files in that directory. This can be enhanced by adding extra options: '-r' for recursive listing, '-f' to display only files, '-s' followed by a specific file name to list only that file, and '-e' followed by a file extension to list files with that extension. To exit the program, the script provides a 'Q' command.
